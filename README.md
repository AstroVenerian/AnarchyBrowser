# AnarchyBrowser
Welcome to the AnarchyBrowser project! The Anarchy Web Browser is an open-source project to design an easy-to-use and visually appealing web browser that is free of trackers. Some core goals of this browser are to offer features that allow you to block ads, connect to a vpn, and freely choose what to do with your browser and user data.
